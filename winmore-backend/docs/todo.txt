WinMore.cards — Master Todo List
Bulk Data Pipeline

1. Create a bulk/ folder structure in the project and add it to .gitignore
2. Create a BulkStorageService that checks if bulk_cards.json exists and reads its creation timestamp
3. Ping Scryfall's bulk data endpoint at startup to retrieve the updated_at timestamp of their latest card dump
4. Compare local timestamp vs Scryfall timestamp — determine if download is needed
5. If no local bulk exists, download the full Scryfall bulk JSON and save as bulk_cards.json
6. If local bulk is outdated, download only the delta (cards updated since last fetch), merge into existing bulk_cards.json
7. Write a startup orchestrator that runs this sequence automatically on every app launch

WinMore Classification Pipeline
8. Define a WinMoreFilter interface so each filter type is its own pluggable class
9. Write filter: Finishers — cards that end games when ahead (e.g. "whenever you attack" mass pump)
10. Write filter: Multipliers — cards that double/triple existing resources (doublers, extra combat, copy effects)
11. Write filter: Anthems — static +X/+X effects that require board presence to matter
12. Write filter: Conditionals — cards with "if you control the most" or "for each" language
13. Run all filters over bulk_cards.json and write matches to winmore_cards.json
14. Persist winmore_cards.json contents into the cards database table with is_win_more = true

Synergy Detection Engine
15. Build a master synergy tag list (ETB, tokens, +1/+1 counters, sacrifice, spellslinger, graveyard, tribal, landfall, lifegain, artifacts, enchantress, etc — target 100+)
16. Write a SynergyTagger that runs keyword and regex matching over oracle text for each card in bulk
17. Persist synergy tags into synergy_tags and card_synergies junction table

Deck Analysis API
18. Create a POST /api/analyze endpoint that accepts a raw list of 100 card names as JSON
19. Resolve submitted card names against your local DB, return error for unrecognized cards
20. Count synergy tag occurrences across the submitted deck and calculate synergy density score
21. Extract win-more cards from the deck, note their synergy tags, calculate win-more count
22. Compute the win-more ratio and apply Commander-aware thresholds to produce a verdict

Recommendation Engine
23. If ratio too high: select replacement suggestions from winmore_cards.json that match deck's dominant synergy but are not already in the deck
24. If ratio too low: suggest win-more cards from filtered bulk that complement the deck's color identity and gameplan
25. Package verdict + synergy breakdown + recommendations into a single structured JSON response

Frontend Groundwork
26. Set up Flutter Web project, confirm it can make HTTP calls to localhost:8080
27. Build deck input screen — accepts raw decklist text, sends to /api/analyze
28. Display synergy breakdown as a pie chart using fl_chart
29. Display win-more cards as draggable Scryfall card images using the Scryfall image URI from your DB
30. Display recommendations as two columns — suggested cuts on the left, suggested additions on the right
